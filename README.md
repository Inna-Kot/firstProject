# My very first  website

Welcome! [Code Institute](http://codeinstitute.net) 

This website was created to help families, parents, and guardians in the physical development of children at home. It provides simple exercises for ages from 1 year old.

Users of this website will be able to find information about why it is so impirtant to develop children physically and what is the positive effect of physical exercises on the child's body. There is also a subscribe form in order to have access to updates that will take place on the site. The site is responsive for all screen sizes.
