# My very first  website

Welcome! [Code Institute](http://codeinstitute.net) 

This website was created to help families, parents, and guardians in the physical development of children at home. It provides simple exercises for ages from 1 year old.

Users of this website will be able to find information about why it is so impirtant to develop children physically and what is the positive effect of physical exercises on the child's body. There is also a subscribe form in order to have access to updates that will take place on the site. The site is responsive for all screen sizes.

## Deployment

### Version Control
1. The site was created using Gitpod editor and pushed to Github repository.
2. Git commands were used throughout the development to push the code to the repository. The following git commands were used:
    -   git add . - to add the files to the staging area before being committed.
    -   git commit -m "commit message" - to commit changes to the local repository queue that are ready for the final step.
    -   git push - to push all committed code to the remote repository on Github.

### Deployment to Github pages
1. The site was deployed to Github pages as follows:
    -   In the Github repository, I navigated to Settings tab
    -   From the source section drop-down menu, I selected the Master branch and Save
    -   Once the Master branch was selected, the page provided the link to the website
-   The live link: [Kids First](https://inna-kot.github.io/firstProject/)


## Wireframes
1. The site was developed with the Mobile-first method. The wireframes were therefore drawn with that thought in mind, and created on a piece of paper with a simple pencil.
