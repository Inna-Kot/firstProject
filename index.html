                <h3>Exercise also encourages social interaction, teaching teamwork and cooperation. It can improve sleep patterns, reduce stress, and elevate mood.</h3> -->

                        <hr>
                        <p>Regular exercise helps children build strong muscles and bones, improves cardiovascular health, and maintains a healthy weight. It reduces the risk of developing chronic conditions like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease later in life.</p>

                        <hr>
                        <p>Physical activity is a natural mood booster. It helps reduce stress, anxiety, and depression in children by releasing endorphins, which are the body's natural feel-good hormones. Exercise also improves sleep patterns, leading to better overall mental health.</p>

                        <p>Exercise enhances brain function by increasing blood flow to the brain, improving concentration, memory, and learning. Active children tend to perform better academically and are more focused in the classroom.</p>
